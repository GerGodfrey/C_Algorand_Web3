# TEAL assignment

In this assignment, you will be tasked to complete the TEAL program in `artifacts/teal_program.teal` that checks the atomic transfer performed in `main.js`.

The atomic transfer includes 2 transactions, the 1st transaction involves sending 1 Algos to the 2nd account. The 2nd transaction involves sending 10% of the 1st transaction amount to the creator account. A password `algorandIsAwesome` is also sent to the program as a transaction argument.

1. Password must be `algorandIsAwesome`
